# Vision And Strategy

## Vision

OARS becomes the default trust and audit layer for enterprise AI agents.

Every agent action should be:

- explicitly authorized
- traceable to identity and policy
- cryptographically receipted
- verifiable by internal and external auditors

## Problem Statement

Organizations are deploying agents into workflows that touch sensitive systems and data.

Current gaps:

- inconsistent policy enforcement across tools and vendors
- weak attribution for who approved what and when
- poor forensic quality in logs
- manual and expensive compliance evidence collection

## Strategic Objective

Build a platform that turns agent execution into a governed, measurable, and auditable control plane.

## Product Thesis

If OARS is easy to place in front of any agent runtime and any enterprise tool, then OARS can become both:

- an operational product category leader
- a technical standard for action receipts and verification

## Differentiators

- Signed receipts as first-class artifacts.
- Policy decisions linked to each receipt.
- Human-in-the-loop control for high-risk actions.
- Direct mapping from runtime events to compliance evidence.
- Vendor-neutral interfaces with open schema design.

## Target Buyers

- CISO and security engineering
- GRC and internal audit
- Platform engineering for AI/automation
- Regulated business units (healthcare, finance, critical services)

## Success Metrics

- Time to integrate first agent and first 5 tools
- Percentage of actions with full verifiable receipts
- Reduction in manual audit preparation time
- Mean time to investigate suspicious action trails
- Percentage of high-risk actions routed through approval policies

## 2026 Strategy

1. Land as mandatory control layer in pilot enterprises.
2. Expand into cross-vendor deployment with interoperability claims.
3. Publish open receipt schema and conformance tests.
4. Drive external adoption via partner integrations and standards groups.
