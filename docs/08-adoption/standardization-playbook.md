# Standardization And Adoption Playbook

## Objective

Drive OARS from enterprise product to required cross-vendor control standard.

## Adoption Strategy

1. Land In Regulated Enterprises
- Target organizations with strong audit pressure.
- Position OARS as mandatory control layer for agent deployment.

2. Build Ecosystem Integrations
- Publish adapters for key agent runtimes and enterprise tools.
- Provide verification SDKs for partner systems.

3. Publish Open Specification
- Open receipt schema and conformance test suite.
- Public interoperability matrix across connectors and runtimes.
- Current publication artifacts:
  - `open-spec/oars-profile-v1.json`
  - `open-spec/compatibility-policy.md`
  - `open-spec/conformance-suite.md`

4. Create Governance Model
- Establish technical steering group.
- Formalize versioning and compatibility policy.

## Standardization Workstreams

- Schema governance and change control
- Signature and trust-root interoperability profile
- Policy decision metadata standardization
- Evidence package interchange profile

## Pilot Program Requirements

- Minimum 3 design partners across different industries.
- Production traffic in at least one critical workflow per partner.
- Demonstrated reduction in audit preparation effort.
- Current pilot evidence register: `docs/08-adoption/pilot-evidence.md`

## Commercial Model

- Enterprise platform subscriptions
- Premium compliance packs
- Managed deployment and support

## Success Criteria

- OARS receipts accepted in external audits
- OARS schema implemented by third-party integrations
- OARS conformance tests adopted in procurement requirements

## Partnership Targets

- Cloud providers
- SIEM and security analytics vendors
- GRC platforms
- Agent runtime and orchestration platforms
